# GenAI Create React App Scaffolder

This application uses OpenAI to help you generate React app scaffolding through a Streamlit interface.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Using venv (Python 3.3+)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit openai python-dotenv
```

or

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project to store your OpenAI API key:

```bash
# Create .env file
touch .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

> **Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Make sure to add it to your `.gitignore` file.

### 4. Running the Streamlit Application

Start the Streamlit app by running:

```bash
streamlit run chatbot.py
```

The application should now be running at http://localhost:8501
